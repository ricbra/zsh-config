My ZSH config
=============

This is my ZSH config. As I hate to reinvent wheels (OK, and I'm lazy), I took [William Durands](git@github.com:willdurand/zsh-config.git) 
configuration and stripped that down to my own preferences. All credits to him! 

Installation
------------

    $ git clone git://github.com/ricbra/zsh-config.git --recursive
    $ cd zsh-config && bin/install
